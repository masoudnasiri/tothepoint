## 🎯 WHAT MAKES THIS SYSTEM SPECIAL

### 1. Multi-Date Delivery Flexibility
Unlike rigid single-date systems, items can have multiple possible delivery dates, enabling real-world procurement scenarios with flexible supplier lead times.

### 2. Portfolio-Level Optimization
Not just per-project optimization - the system analyzes ALL projects together, allocating resources based on priority weights for true portfolio management.

### 3. Calendar-Based Planning
Real calendar dates (not abstract slots) throughout the system for realistic project planning and scheduling.

### 4. Configurable Decision Making
Optimization factors are configurable via UI, allowing the system to be tuned to organizational priorities.

### 5. Complete Lifecycle Tracking
From requirement definition to cash receipt, every stage is tracked with dates and status.

### 6. Decision Management
Results aren't just displayed - they can be reviewed, manually edited, and saved as finalized decisions with full audit trail.
