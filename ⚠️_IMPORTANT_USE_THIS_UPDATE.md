# ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Use THIS Update Package!

## 🚨 Previous Update Was Incomplete!

**The previous update package (v1.0.1) was missing the frontend fix!**

That's why you still see:
- ❌ "Default Login Credentials: Admin: admin / admin123..." on login screen
- ❌ Password changes might not work

## ✅ THIS IS THE COMPLETE UPDATE (v1.0.2)

**New Package:** `pdss-update-v1.0.2-COMPLETE.zip`

**What's Fixed:**
- ✅ Backend: Password change functionality (2 files)
- ✅ Frontend: Removed credentials from login screen (1 file) ← **THIS WAS MISSING!**

---

## 📦 What Was Wrong With v1.0.1

### v1.0.1 (Incomplete - DON'T USE)

update_files/
└── backend/        ← Only backend files
    └── app/
        ├── schemas.py
        └── crud.py
```

**Result:** Backend fixed, but login screen still showed credentials!

### v1.0.2 (Complete - USE THIS!)
```
update_files/
├── backend/        ← Backend files
│   └── app/
│       ├── schemas.py
│       └── crud.py
└── frontend/       ← Frontend file (WAS MISSING!)
    └── src/
        └── pages/
            └── LoginPage.tsx  ← REMOVES CREDENTIALS FROM SCREEN
```

**Result:** Everything fixed! ✓

## ✅ What Will Change

### Login Screen - BEFORE Update:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Default Login Credentials:       │
│ Admin: admin / admin123          │  ← BAD! Security risk
│ PM: pm1 / pm123                  │
│ Procurement: proc1 / proc123     │
│ Finance: finance1 / finance123   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Login Screen - AFTER Update:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE:              │  ← GOOD! Secure
│ Change default passwords         │
│ immediately after first login    │
│ for security.                    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Password Change - BEFORE:
- ❌ Doesn't save
- ❌ Not working

### Password Change - AFTER:
- ✅ Saves correctly
- ✅ Fully working

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting

### If credentials still show on login screen:

This means frontend wasn't rebuilt. Run:

```bash
cd ~/pdss  # or ~/pdss-linux-v1.0.0
docker-compose down
docker-compose build frontend --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
sleep 60
```

Then check http://193.162.129.58:3000 again.

### If password change still doesn't work:

This means backend wasn't rebuilt. Run:

```bash
cd ~/pdss
docker-compose down
docker-compose build backend --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
sleep 60
```

Then test password change again.

### If both issues persist:

Do complete rebuild:

```bash
cd ~/pdss
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
sleep 90
docker-compose ps  # All should show "Up"
```

---

## 📊 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if frontend file was updated
grep -i "SECURITY NOTICE" frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx
# Should show: <strong>⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE:</strong>

grep -i "admin123" frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx
# Should show: NOTHING (credentials removed!)

# Check if backend files were updated
grep -i "password.*Optional" backend/app/schemas.py
# Should show: password: Optional[str] = Field(...)

# Check containers
docker-compose ps
# All 3 should show "Up"
```
