---

## Step 2: Dynamic Execution

### Prerequisites
To complete dynamic execution testing, the following must be running:
- Docker Desktop
- PostgreSQL container (port 5432)

### Execution Instructions

**Option 1: Start Full Application Stack**
```bash
# Start all services (PostgreSQL, Backend, Frontend)
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

**Option 2: Run Verification Script**
```bash
# Ensure Docker services are running
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres

# Run verification script
cd backend
python -m app.database  # Initialize DB
python -m app.seed_data  # Seed data

# Or use the automated verification script
python verify_phase1.py
```

### Expected Execution Flow

1. **Database Initialization** (`init_db()`)
   - Connects to PostgreSQL database
   - Runs `Base.metadata.create_all()`
   - Creates all tables based on SQLAlchemy models
   - Applies check constraints
   - Creates indexes

2. **Data Seeding** (`seed_sample_data()`)
   - Executes each seeding function in order
   - Handles duplicate checks (idempotent)
   - Commits data in batches
   - Logs progress

3. **Expected Output** (No Errors)
   ```
   INFO: Starting to seed sample data...
   INFO: Sample users created successfully
   INFO: Sample projects created successfully
   INFO: Sample project assignments created successfully
   INFO: Sample project phases created successfully
   INFO: Sample procurement options created successfully
   INFO: Sample budget data created successfully
   INFO: Sample project items created successfully
   INFO: Sample decision factor weights created successfully
   INFO: Sample data seeding completed successfully!
   ```

### Status: ⏸️ PENDING USER EXECUTION

**Reason:** Docker Desktop not currently running on Windows system.

**Note:** The `backend/app/main.py` automatically calls `init_db()` and `seed_sample_data()` during FastAPI startup (lines 21-34), so simply starting the application will trigger both operations.

---

## Step 3: Data Integrity Inspection

### Verification Queries

The following SQL queries should be executed once the database is populated:

#### Query 1: Projects Table
```sql
SELECT project_code, priority_weight FROM projects ORDER BY project_code;
```

**Expected Results:**
| project_code | priority_weight |
|--------------|-----------------|
| PROJ001      | 8               |
| PROJ002      | 6               |
| PROJ003      | 5               |

**Verification Criteria:**
- ✓ All priority_weight values are integers
- ✓ All values are between 1 and 10
- ✓ 3 projects exist

---

#### Query 2: Project Items Table
```sql
SELECT item_code, required_by_date, status FROM project_items LIMIT 5;

FROM project_phases ph 
JOIN projects p ON ph.project_id = p.id 
ORDER BY p.project_code, ph.start_date;
```

**Expected Results (Sample):**
| project_code | phase_name           | start_date | end_date   |
|--------------|----------------------|------------|------------|
| PROJ001      | Q1-2025 Planning     | 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-31 |

| ...          | ...                  | ...        | ...        |

**Verification Criteria:**
- ✓ Phases are linked to projects (join works)
- ✓ start_date < end_date for all records
- ✓ Phases are sequential per project
- ✓ 12 total phases (4 per project × 3 projects)

#### Query 4: Decision Factor Weights Table
```sql
SELECT factor_name, weight, description FROM decision_factor_weights ORDER BY weight DESC;
```

**Expected Results:**
| factor_name                  | weight | description                                    |
|------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| cost_minimization            | 9      | Prioritize minimizing total procurement cost   |
| cash_flow_balance            | 8      | Balance cash outflows across time periods      |
| lead_time_optimization       | 7      | Optimize delivery times to meet project deadlines |
| supplier_rating              | 6      | Consider supplier reliability and quality ratings |
| bundle_discount_maximization | 5      | Maximize bulk purchase discounts when possible |

**Verification Criteria:**
- ✓ 5 factors exist
- ✓ All weights are between 1 and 10
- ✓ factor_name values are unique
- ✓ Descriptions are present and meaningful

---

#### Query 5: New Tables Existence
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM finalized_decisions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM optimization_runs;
```

**Expected Results:**
- finalized_decisions: 0 records (empty after initial seeding)
- optimization_runs: 0 records (empty after initial seeding)

**Verification Criteria:**
- ✓ Tables exist and are queryable
- ✓ No errors on SELECT operations
- ✓ Empty state is expected (populated by application usage)

---

#### Query 6: Verify Old Fields Removed
```sql
-- These queries should FAIL with "column does not exist" error
SELECT must_buy_time FROM project_items LIMIT 1;
SELECT allowed_times FROM project_items LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Both queries should return error: `column "must_buy_time" does not exist`
- Both queries should return error: `column "allowed_times" does not exist`

**Verification Criteria:**
- ✓ Old time-slot fields are completely removed
- ✓ Schema migration is complete

---

### Automated Verification Script

A Python verification script (`verify_phase1.py`) has been created that automates all the above checks. Run it with:

```bash
python verify_phase1.py
```

The script will:
1. Initialize the database schema
2. Seed sample data
3. Execute all verification queries
4. Validate results against expected values
5. Output a pass/fail report
