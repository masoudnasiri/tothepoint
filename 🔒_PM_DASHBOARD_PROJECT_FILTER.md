# 🔒 PM Dashboard - Assigned Projects Only Filter

## ✅ **YOUR REQUEST - IMPLEMENTED!**

**You Said:**
> "now we need limit the dashboard information according to the project assigned to each project manager it means all projects just all projects that assigned to the pm and don't show cashflow of other projects for pm"

**Status:** ✅ **PM DASHBOARD NOW FILTERED BY ASSIGNED PROJECTS!**

---

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### **BEFORE (Security Issue):**
```
PM User (pm1) assigned to:
├─ Project A
└─ Project C

Dashboard showed:
├─ Revenue from Project A ✅ (Assigned)
├─ Revenue from Project B ❌ (NOT assigned - shouldn't see!)
├─ Revenue from Project C ✅ (Assigned)
├─ Revenue from Project D ❌ (NOT assigned - shouldn't see!)
└─ Revenue from Project E ❌ (NOT assigned - shouldn't see!)

Total Revenue: $500,000 (ALL projects) ❌ WRONG!
```

### **AFTER (Secure & Correct):**
```
PM User (pm1) assigned to:
├─ Project A
└─ Project C

Dashboard shows:
├─ Revenue from Project A ✅ (Assigned)
└─ Revenue from Project C ✅ (Assigned)
   (No data from B, D, E - not assigned)

Total Revenue: $150,000 (Only assigned projects) ✅ CORRECT!
```

---

## 🔒 **Security & Privacy**

### **Why This Matters:**

**Before Fix - Data Leakage:**
```
PM sees revenue from ALL projects:
├─ Can see Project X revenue → $2M sensitive contract
├─ Can see Project Y revenue → $500K confidential deal
└─ Can see competitor project data

Risk: Information leakage across projects! ❌
```

**After Fix - Proper Isolation:**
```
PM sees revenue from ASSIGNED projects ONLY:
├─ Sees only Project A revenue → Their responsibility
└─ Sees only Project C revenue → Their responsibility
   Cannot see other projects' financials

Result: Proper data isolation! ✅
```

---

## 📊 **Data Flow**

### **PM Dashboard Query Logic:**

```python
# Step 1: Get PM's assigned projects
assigned_projects = await get_user_projects(db, current_user)
# Returns: [1, 3] (Project A = 1, Project C = 3)

# Step 2: Join cashflow with decisions
query = query.join(
    FinalizedDecision,
    CashflowEvent.related_decision_id == FinalizedDecision.id
)

# Step 3: Filter by assigned projects + INFLOW
query = query.where(
    CashflowEvent.event_type == "INFLOW",
    FinalizedDecision.project_id.in_([1, 3])  # Only assigned!
)

# Result: Only cashflow from Projects 1 and 3
```

## 📋 **Dashboard Data by Role**

| Role | Projects Shown | Data Shown | Filter Behavior |
|------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Admin** | ALL | All cashflow | No restrictions |
| **PMO** | ALL | All cashflow | No restrictions |
| **PM** | **Assigned only** ✅ | **Assigned projects only** ✅ | Filtered automatically |
| **Finance** | ALL | All cashflow | No restrictions |
| **Procurement** | ALL | Payments only | No restrictions |

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Test Scenario: PM1 vs PM2 See Different Data**

```
Setup:
======
Project A assigned to: pm1
Project B assigned to: pm2
Project C assigned to: pm1 and pm2

Each project has $100K revenue

Test PM1:
=========
1. Login as pm1 (pm1 / pm123)
2. Navigate to Dashboard
3. Check "Total Revenue Inflow"
4. Expected: $200K (Project A: $100K + Project C: $100K)
5. ✅ Should NOT see Project B's $100K

Test PM2:
=========
1. Logout
2. Login as pm2 (pm2 / pm123)  
3. Navigate to Dashboard
4. Check "Total Revenue Inflow"
5. Expected: $200K (Project B: $100K + Project C: $100K)
6. ✅ Should NOT see Project A's $100K

Test PMO:
=========
1. Logout
2. Login as pmo1 (pmo1 / pmo123)
3. Navigate to Dashboard
4. Check "Total Revenue Inflow"
5. Expected: $300K (All projects: A + B + C)
6. ✅ Sees everything
```

## 🎨 **Visual Example**

### **Scenario:**

**Projects in System:**
```
Project A (INFRA-001): $80,000 revenue → Assigned to pm1
Project B (COMM-002):  $120,000 revenue → Assigned to pm2
Project C (ENERGY-003): $50,000 revenue → Assigned to pm1 & pm2
Total: $250,000
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Database Query:**

**For PM Users:**
```sql
-- Get cashflow events
SELECT cashflow_events.*
FROM cashflow_events
INNER JOIN finalized_decisions 
  ON cashflow_events.related_decision_id = finalized_decisions.id
INNER JOIN project_assignments
  ON finalized_decisions.project_id = project_assignments.project_id
WHERE project_assignments.user_id = {pm_user_id}  -- ✅ Only assigned
  AND cashflow_events.event_type = 'INFLOW'
  AND cashflow_events.is_cancelled = FALSE
ORDER BY cashflow_events.event_date;
```

**For PMO/Admin/Finance:**
```sql
-- Get all cashflow events (no project filter)
SELECT cashflow_events.*
FROM cashflow_events
WHERE cashflow_events.is_cancelled = FALSE
ORDER BY cashflow_events.event_date;
```

---

### **Code Changes:**

**File:** `backend/app/routers/dashboard.py`

**Cashflow Analysis (Lines 57-73):**
```python
if current_user.role == "pm":
    # Get PM's assigned projects
    assigned_projects = await get_user_projects(db, current_user)
    
    if assigned_projects:
        # JOIN with finalized_decisions and filter
        query = query.join(
            FinalizedDecision,
            CashflowEvent.related_decision_id == FinalizedDecision.id
        ).where(
            CashflowEvent.event_type == "INFLOW",
            FinalizedDecision.project_id.in_(assigned_projects)
        )
    else:
        # No assignments = empty result
        query = query.where(CashflowEvent.id == None)
```

**Dashboard Summary (Lines 189-234):**
```python
if current_user.role == "pm":
    assigned_projects = await get_user_projects(db, current_user)
    
    if assigned_projects:
        # Count with JOIN
        events_count_query = select(func.count(CashflowEvent.id))
            .select_from(CashflowEvent)
            .join(FinalizedDecision, ...)
            .where(
                CashflowEvent.event_type == "INFLOW",
                CashflowEvent.is_cancelled == False,
                FinalizedDecision.project_id.in_(assigned_projects)
            )
        
        # Sum with JOIN
        inflow_query = select(func.sum(CashflowEvent.amount))
            .select_from(CashflowEvent)
            .join(FinalizedDecision, ...)
            .where(...)
```

---

## 🚀 **ALREADY APPLIED!**

**Backend restarted - Just refresh browser!**

```
1. Press F5
2. Login as PM (pm1 / pm123)
3. Navigate to Dashboard
4. ✅ See only assigned projects' revenue
5. ✅ No data from other projects
6. ✅ Secure!

7. Logout
8. Login as PMO (pmo1 / pmo123)
9. Navigate to Dashboard
10. ✅ See ALL projects' data
11. ✅ Complete overview
```

---

## ✅ **Summary**

### **Security Improvement:**
- ❌ **Before:** PM saw ALL projects' revenue (data leakage)
- ✅ **After:** PM sees only ASSIGNED projects' revenue

### **What Changed:**
1. ✅ Cashflow query filtered by assigned projects
2. ✅ Dashboard summary filtered by assigned projects
3. ✅ Chart shows only assigned projects
4. ✅ Table shows only assigned projects

### **Who Affected:**
- ✅ **PM users:** Now see only assigned projects (more secure)
- ✅ **PMO users:** Still see all (no change)
- ✅ **Admin/Finance:** Still see all (no change)

---

## 💡 **Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: Confidential Projects**

```
Scenario: Project X is confidential, assigned to pm1 only

Before: pm2 could see Project X revenue in dashboard ❌
After: pm2 cannot see Project X at all ✅

Benefit: Project confidentiality maintained!
```

### **Use Case 2: Competitor Analysis**

```
Scenario: Project A and B are for competing clients

Before: pm1 (Project A) could see pm2's (Project B) revenue ❌
After: Each PM only sees their own project revenue ✅

Benefit: No competitive information leakage!
```

### **Use Case 3: Need-to-Know Basis**

```
Scenario: PMs should only know about their projects

Before: PM could monitor other projects' performance ❌
After: PM focuses only on assigned projects ✅

Benefit: Proper information compartmentalization!
```

---

## 📊 **Verification**

### **Check PM Can Only See Assigned:**

```powershell
# In backend logs, you should see:
docker-compose logs backend | findstr "assigned projects"

# Expected for PM users:
"PM user has 2 assigned projects: [1, 3]"
"Filtering dashboard by assigned projects: [1, 3]"
```

### **Database Query:**

```sql
-- Check what projects PM1 is assigned to
SELECT p.project_code, pa.assigned_at
FROM project_assignments pa
JOIN projects p ON pa.project_id = p.id
WHERE pa.user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'pm1');

-- Result:
project_code | assigned_at
-------------+-------------
INFRA-001    | 2025-10-09
ENERGY-003   | 2025-10-09

-- PM1 should only see revenue from these 2 projects!
```

---

## 🎊 **COMPLETE!**

**Security:** ✅ PM data properly isolated  
**Backend:** ✅ Restarted  
**Action:** Just **refresh browser** (F5)  

---

**Test with different PM users and verify they see different data! 🔒**
