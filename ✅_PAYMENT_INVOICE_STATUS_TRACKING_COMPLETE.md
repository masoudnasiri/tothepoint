## 🐛 **Issue Fixed: Dialog Not Closing**

### **Problem:**
After clicking "Submit Actual Payment Data", the dialog didn't close and users couldn't tell if the data was saved.

- Validation logic was preventing submission even when data was valid
- No clear success feedback

### **Solution:**
1. ✅ Improved validation logic with clear error messages
2. ✅ Calculate total payment amount correctly for installments
3. ✅ Close dialog immediately after successful submit
4. ✅ Show success message: "✅ Actual payment data entered successfully! Cashflow events created."
5. ✅ Refresh decisions list to show updated data
