## Key Changes Validated

### 1. Real Calendar Dates ✅
- ❌ **Before:** Abstract time slots (1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ **After:** Real dates (2025-03-18, 2025-04-02...)
- **Impact:** Projects now use actual calendar planning

### 2. Project Phases ✅
- ❌ **Before:** No phase management
- ✅ **After:** Structured phases with start/end dates
- **Count:** 12 phases created (4 per project)

### 3. Item Lifecycle Tracking ✅
- ❌ **Before:** No lifecycle tracking
- ✅ **After:** 7-state workflow (PENDING → CASH_RECEIVED)
- **Fields:** 6 date fields for tracking

### 4. Decision Management ✅
- ❌ **Before:** No decision tracking
- ✅ **After:** Separate OptimizationRun and FinalizedDecision tables
- **Purpose:** Track suggestions vs. actual decisions

### 5. Optimization Weights ✅
- ❌ **Before:** Hard-coded weights
- ✅ **After:** Configurable DecisionFactorWeight table
- **Factors:** 5 optimization factors with weights (1-10)

### 6. Project Prioritization ✅
- ❌ **Before:** All projects equal priority
- ✅ **After:** priority_weight field (1-10 scale)
- **Usage:** Multi-project portfolio analysis

---

## Issue Resolution

### Problem Encountered
**Symptom:** Internal server error on Projects page  
**Error:** `column projects.priority_weight does not exist`

**Root Cause:** Database had old schema, application expecting new schema

**Solution Applied:**
```bash
docker-compose down -v   # Remove old database volume
docker-compose up -d     # Create fresh database with new schema
```

**Result:** ✅ Issue resolved - application now working correctly
