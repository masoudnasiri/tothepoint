# 🎯 **MULTI-CURRENCY CHARTS FIXED!**

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED - SEPARATE CURRENCY CHARTS NOW WORK**

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **MULTI-CURRENCY CHARTS FUNCTIONAL**

---

## 🎉 **WHAT WAS THE ISSUE**

You were correct! The issue was that when you selected "Original Currencies", the **cashflow charts** were still showing unified data instead of separate charts for each currency.

**❌ PROBLEM**: 
- Cashflow charts always showed single unified chart
- Even in "Original Currencies" mode, charts showed base currency only
- No separation of currencies in the visual graphs

**✅ SOLUTION**: 
- Modified chart rendering logic
- In "Original Currencies" mode: Shows separate chart for each currency
- In "Unified" mode: Shows single chart with all currencies converted to IRR

---

## 🎯 **WHAT'S FIXED NOW**

### **Original Currency Mode** (Now Working!):
```
When you select "Original Currencies":

✅ Shows SEPARATE CHART for each currency:

┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ USD - Forecasted Monthly Cash Flow │
│ Currency: USD                      │
│ [USD Chart with USD amounts]       │
│ Y-axis: "Amount (USD)"             │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ EUR - Forecasted Monthly Cash Flow │
│ Currency: EUR                      │
│ [EUR Chart with EUR amounts]       │
│ Y-axis: "Amount (EUR)"             │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IRR - Forecasted Monthly Cash Flow │
│ Currency: IRR                      │
│ [IRR Chart with IRR amounts]       │
│ Y-axis: "Amount (IRR)"             │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Unified Mode** (Still Working):
```
When "UNIFIED (IRR)" is selected:

✅ Shows SINGLE CHART:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Forecasted Monthly Cash Flow       │
│ [Single chart with all amounts     │
│  converted to IRR]                 │
│ Y-axis: "Amount (USD)"             │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 🎨 **VISUAL DIFFERENCES**

### **Before** (Unified only):
```
Original Currencies mode:
❌ Single chart showing unified data
❌ Y-axis: "Amount (USD)" (misleading)
❌ All amounts mixed together
```

### **After** (Multi-Currency Charts):
```
Original Currencies mode:
✅ Multiple charts (one per currency)
✅ USD Chart: "Amount (USD)" 
✅ EUR Chart: "Amount (EUR)"
✅ IRR Chart: "Amount (IRR)"
✅ Each chart shows only that currency's data
✅ Clear separation by currency
```
