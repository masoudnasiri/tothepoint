## üîí **Changes Made**

### **1. Dashboard Access - RESTRICTED** ‚úÖ

**Before:**

**After:**
- PM can ONLY see **Revenue Inflow** data
- PM **CANNOT** see:
  - Budget allocations
  - Payment outflows
  - Net cash position
  - Cumulative balances

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `backend/app/routers/dashboard.py`

- Requires financial authority

**Files Modified:**

- Create/edit/delete project items
- Manage delivery options
- Update project phases
- View project status

### ‚úÖ **Read-Only Access:**

## üéØ **Testing the Changes**

### **Test as PM User (In Docker):**

```powershell
# 1. Start Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Open browser
start http://localhost:3000

# 3. Login as PM
# If you don't have a PM user, create one in Users page as admin

- VERIFY: NO Budget, Outflow, Net, or Balance columns

# 5. Test Advanced Optimization

- VERIFY: NO "Run Optimization" button
- VERIFY: Can see proposals (if Finance ran optimization)
- VERIFY: NO "Save Proposal" button
- VERIFY: NO "Finalize & Lock" button

# 6. Test Finalized Decisions
- Click "Finalized Decisions"
- VERIFY: Can see decisions
- VERIFY: NO "Finalize" or "Lock" buttons
```

### **Test as Finance User:**

```powershell
# 1. Login as Finance/Admin

# 2. Test Dashboard
- VERIFY: Title says "Cash Flow Analysis Dashboard"
- VERIFY: All 4 cards show
- VERIFY: Chart shows all data
- VERIFY: Table shows all columns

# 3. Test Advanced Optimization
- VERIFY: Can click "Run Optimization"
- VERIFY: Can save proposals

## üìã **Database Verification**

### **What Data PM Can Access:**

```sql
-- PM users can only query inflows:
SELECT 
    event_date,
    amount,
    description
FROM cashflow_events
WHERE event_type = 'INFLOW'
  AND is_cancelled = false;
```

### **What Data PM Cannot Access:**

```sql
-- PM cannot see these (blocked by API):
SELECT * FROM budget_data;                    -- Blocked
SELECT * FROM cashflow_events WHERE event_type = 'OUTFLOW';  -- Blocked

-- PM cannot execute these operations:
INSERT INTO finalized_decisions ...;          -- 403 Forbidden
UPDATE finalized_decisions SET status = 'LOCKED' ...;  -- 403 Forbidden
```

---

## üöÄ **Deployment in Docker**

### **Apply Permission Changes:**

```powershell
# 1. Stop containers
docker-compose down

# 2. Rebuild (code changes are already in place)
docker-compose build backend frontend

# 3. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Verify
docker-compose ps

# 5. Test with PM user
# Open http://localhost:3000 and login as PM
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **For PM Users:**

If you're a PM user, you'll notice:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard looks different (Revenue-focused)
- ‚úÖ Less data visible (revenue only)
- ‚ùå Cannot save or finalize optimization results
- ‚úÖ Can still manage your projects fully

**If you need financial data access:**
- Contact your Admin to upgrade your role to Finance
- Or request specific reports from Finance team

### **For Finance/Admin Users:**

Your access is **unchanged**:
- ‚úÖ All features still available
- ‚úÖ Full financial data visible
- ‚úÖ Complete control over optimizations
- ‚úÖ Can finalize and lock decisions

---

## üìû **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: PM user sees "403 Forbidden"**

**Expected!** PM users cannot access certain endpoints.

**Solutions:**
- If PM needs access ‚Üí Upgrade role to Finance
- If it's for viewing ‚Üí Share read-only reports
- If it's for decision-making ‚Üí Finance should handle

### **Issue: PM dashboard is empty**

**Check:**
```sql
-- Verify inflow events exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cashflow_events WHERE event_type = 'INFLOW';
```

**Solution:**
- Need to have finalized decisions first
- Finance team should save and finalize proposals
- Revenue inflows generated from finalized decisions

### **Issue: PM cannot see optimization results**

**Solution:**
- Finance/Admin must run optimization first
- PM can only view existing results
- PM should request Finance to run optimization

---
