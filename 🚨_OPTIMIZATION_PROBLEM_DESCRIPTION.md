# 🚨 Optimization Problem Description - Help Needed

## 📋 **Problem Summary:**

Our procurement optimization system is **working perfectly** but producing **0 items** instead of the expected ~310 items. We believe we have **sufficient budget** but the optimizer thinks otherwise.

### **Technology Stack:**
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Python + OR-Tools (CP-SAT solver)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Material-UI
- **Deployment:** Docker + Docker Compose

### **Optimization Engine:**
- **Solver:** Google OR-Tools CP-SAT (Constraint Programming)
- **Objective:** Minimize(Cost - Purchase_Bonus)
- **Constraints:** Budget limits per time slot + Demand fulfillment
- **Strategies:** 5 different optimization approaches

## 📊 **Current Data:**

### **Projects & Items:**
```
📈 PROJECT DATA:
   Total Projects: 10 (IT infrastructure projects)
   Total Items: 310 items
   Total Quantity: 17,062 units
   Item Cost Range: $50 - $2,000 per unit
   Average Item Cost: ~$62,400 per item
```

### **Budget Data:**
```
💰 BUDGET DATA:
   Total Budget: $14,150,000
   Budget Periods: 12 months
   Monthly Budgets: $600K - $2M per month
   Budget Distribution: Higher in early months, declining
```

### **Procurement Options:**
```
🛒 PROCUREMENT OPTIONS:
   Total Options: 142 suppliers
   Options per Item: 3-5 suppliers average
   Cost Variation: Different prices for same items
   Lead Times: 1-5 months
```

---

## 🎯 **The Problem:**

### **What We Expect:**
```
✅ EXPECTED RESULTS:
   Items Optimized: ~310 items
   Total Cost: ~$18-19M
   Different strategies should produce different results
   Budget utilization: ~80-90%
```

### **What We Get:**
```
❌ ACTUAL RESULTS:
   Items Optimized: 0 items
   Total Cost: $0
   All strategies produce identical results
   Status: "SUCCESS" but no decisions made
```

---

## 🔍 **What We've Tried:**

### **1. Purchase Bonus Adjustment:**
```python
# Original: PURCHASE_BONUS = 100000000  # $100M (too large)
# Tried:    PURCHASE_BONUS = 10000     # $10K (too small)  
# Current:  PURCHASE_BONUS = 50000     # $50K (still not working)
```

### **2. Strategy Logic Verification:**
```python
# ✅ VERIFIED: Strategy weights are calculated correctly
LOWEST_COST:        weight = 1.0
PRIORITY_WEIGHTED:  weight = 11 - priority (higher priority = lower weight)
FAST_DELIVERY:      weight = 12 - delivery_time (earlier = lower weight)
SMOOTH_CASHFLOW:    weight = 1.0 + |delivery_time - 8.5| * 0.2
BALANCED:           weight = priority_factor + delivery_factor
```

### **3. Constraint Analysis:**
```python
# ✅ VERIFIED: Time slots start from 5 (not 1)
# ✅ VERIFIED: Budget constraints use $1M default for missing slots
# ✅ VERIFIED: Demand constraints are <= 1 (can skip items)
```

## 🤔 **Key Questions for Your Friends:**

### **Question 1: Budget Feasibility**
```
📊 BUDGET vs COST ANALYSIS:
   Total Budget Available: $14,150,000
   Estimated Total Cost: $17,488,550 (items × quantity × avg_price)
   Budget Shortfall: $3,338,550 (19% gap)
   
❓ Is this budget constraint realistic for optimization?
❓ Should we increase budgets or is there another issue?
```

### **Question 2: Purchase Bonus Logic**
```
🎯 OBJECTIVE FUNCTION:
   Formula: Minimize(Cost × Weight - Purchase_Bonus)
   
   Current Settings:
   - Average Item Cost: $62,400
   - Purchase Bonus: $50,000
   - Net Cost per Item: $12,400
   
❓ Is this purchase bonus logic correct?
❓ Should the bonus be higher/lower?
❓ Is the objective function formulation right?
```

### **Question 3: Constraint Formulation**
```
🔒 CONSTRAINT STRUCTURE:
   Budget Constraint: sum(cost × quantity) <= monthly_budget
   Demand Constraint: sum(decisions_per_item) <= 1
   Time Constraint: purchase_time = delivery_time - lead_time >= 1
   
❓ Are these constraints correctly formulated?
❓ Is the demand constraint too restrictive?
❓ Are we missing any critical constraints?
```

### **Question 4: Data Structure**
```
📋 DATA STRUCTURE QUESTIONS:
   - Items have multiple procurement options (3-5 per item)
   - Each option has different cost, lead time, payment terms
   - Budget is allocated per month, not per item
   - Projects have different priority weights (3-8)
   
❓ Is this data structure suitable for optimization?
❓ Should we modify the data model?
❓ Are there data quality issues?
```

## 🎯 **Specific Technical Issues:**

### **Issue 1: CP-SAT Returns 0 Items**
```
Problem: CP-SAT solver finds no feasible solution
Status: OPTIMAL but 0 decisions
Possible Causes:
- Budget constraints too tight
- Demand constraints too restrictive  
- Time constraints infeasible
- Purchase bonus too small
```

### **Issue 2: All Strategies Identical**
```
Problem: LOWEST_COST, PRIORITY_WEIGHTED, FAST_DELIVERY all return same result
Possible Causes:
- Purchase bonus dominates strategy weights
- Constraint infeasibility overrides strategy differences
- Objective function not properly weighted
```

### **Issue 3: GLOP Returns Unrealistic Results**
```
Problem: GLOP solver returns ~272,000 items (impossible)
Possible Causes:
- Continuous relaxation issues
- Constraint formulation differences
- Variable bounds problems
```

## 💡 **Our Hypothesis:**

We believe the issue is **budget constraint infeasibility**:

1. **Math:** $14.1M budget vs $17.5M estimated cost = 19% shortfall
2. **Solver Logic:** Can't satisfy all constraints simultaneously
3. **Result:** Chooses to buy nothing rather than partial solution

## 🚀 **What We Need Help With:**

### **Expertise Needed:**
- **Operations Research:** Constraint programming, linear programming
- **OR-Tools:** CP-SAT solver behavior, constraint formulation
- **Business Logic:** Procurement optimization best practices
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Objective function design

### **Specific Help:**
1. **Review our constraint formulation**
2. **Validate our objective function**
3. **Suggest budget vs cost ratio**
4. **Recommend purchase bonus logic**
5. **Identify any missing constraints**

## 🎯 **Success Criteria:**

We want the optimization to:
1. **Return ~310 items** (not 0)
2. **Use ~80-90% of budget** (not 0%)
3. **Show different results** for different strategies
4. **Complete in reasonable time** (< 60 seconds)
