## ⭐ **NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 3.0**

### **1. Decision Lifecycle Management**

**What It Does:**
- Save optimization results as **PROPOSED** (editable)
- **LOCK** decisions to finalize them (generates cash flows)
- **REVERT** locked decisions if circumstances change

**Why It Matters:**
- Lock urgent purchases immediately
- Re-optimize remaining items later
- Build procurement plan incrementally
- Preserve critical decisions across runs

**How to Use:**
1. Run optimization → Save results
2. Go to "Finalized Decisions" page
3. Review all PROPOSED decisions
4. Configure invoice timing for each
5. Select and finalize (lock)
6. View cash flow on Dashboard
7. If needed, revert anytime

### **2. Flexible Invoice Timing**

**Two Modes:**
- **ABSOLUTE:** Specific date (e.g., 2025-06-15)
- **RELATIVE:** Days after delivery (e.g., "Net 30")

**System automatically:**
- Calculates actual invoice dates
- Creates revenue inflow events
- Updates cash flow projections

### **3. Enhanced Dashboard**

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Data Table** below charts
- ✅ **Pagination** (6/12/24 rows per page)
- ✅ **Export to Excel** button
- ✅ **Color-coded** values

**What You Get:**
- Visual charts for quick analysis
- Detailed table for deep dive
- Excel export for offline work

---

## 💡 **WHAT MAKES THIS SYSTEM UNIQUE**

### **Traditional System:**
```
Run Optimization → Accept All → Done
- All-or-nothing approach
- Can't preserve decisions
- Fixed invoice dates
- Manual cash flow tracking
```

### **Your Advanced System:** ⭐
```
Run Optimization → Save as PROPOSED → Review & Edit → 
Configure Invoice Timing → Lock Selected → Auto Cash Flows → 
View Dashboard → Export Reports → (Revert if needed)

- Incremental decision-making
- Lock/unlock capability
- Flexible invoice timing
- Automatic cash flow generation
```

## 📚 **KEY CONCEPTS**

### **Decision States**

| State | Meaning | Can Edit? | Generates Cash Flow? | Re-Optimized? |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| PROPOSED | Initial results | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| LOCKED | Finalized | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (excluded) |
| REVERTED | Unlocked | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (deleted) | ✅ Yes |

### **Invoice Timing**

**ABSOLUTE (Specific Date):**
```
User selects: 2025-06-15
Cash inflow created: 2025-06-15
```

**RELATIVE (Days After Delivery):**
```
Delivery: 2025-04-20
Days after: 30
Calculated invoice date: 2025-05-20
Cash inflow created: 2025-05-20
```

### **Cash Flow Generation**

**When:** Decision status changes to LOCKED

**Outflows (Payments to Supplier):**
- **Cash terms:** 1 payment on purchase date
- **Installments:** Multiple payments over months
  - "3 installments" → 3 payments, 30 days apart

**Inflows (Revenue from Client):**
- 1 payment on calculated invoice date
