### 6. ‚ö° Optimization Engine

**Access:** Admin, Finance Manager

**Purpose:** Run optimization to find the best procurement strategy

**What it does:**
The optimization algorithm:
1. ‚úÖ Analyzes all project items and their requirements
2. ‚úÖ Evaluates all procurement options
3. ‚úÖ Considers budget constraints per period
4. ‚úÖ Accounts for lead times and delivery schedules
5. ‚úÖ Applies bulk discounts where applicable
6. ‚úÖ Optimizes payment terms (cash vs credit)
7. ‚úÖ Minimizes total procurement cost

**How to run optimization:**

1. **Prepare Your Data** (already done with sample data):
   - ‚úÖ Create projects
   - ‚úÖ Add project items with timing requirements
   - ‚úÖ Define procurement options for each item
   - ‚úÖ Set budget limits

2. **Run Optimization:**
   - Navigate to **Optimization** page
   - Click **"Run Optimization"** button
   - Configure parameters:
     - **Max Time Slots**: 12 (default)
     - **Time Limit**: 300 seconds (default)
   - Click **"Run Optimization"**

3. **Wait for Results:**
   - Progress indicator shows optimization is running
   - Usually takes 5-60 seconds depending on problem size
   - Alert will show when complete

4. **Review Results:**
   - **Status**: OPTIMAL / FEASIBLE / INFEASIBLE
   - **Total Cost**: Minimized total procurement cost
   - **Items Optimized**: Number of items processed
   - **Execution Time**: How long it took

5. **Analyze Purchase Schedule:**
   - View detailed table showing:
     - Which items to buy
     - From which suppliers (implicitly)
     - When to purchase (period)
     - When delivery occurs
     - Quantities and costs

**Optimization Results Interpretation:**

**OPTIMAL Status:**
```
‚úÖ Best possible solution found
‚úÖ No better solution exists
‚úÖ All constraints satisfied
‚úÖ Minimum cost achieved
```

**FEASIBLE Status:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Valid solution found
‚ö†Ô∏è May not be the absolute best
‚ö†Ô∏è All constraints satisfied
‚ö†Ô∏è Time limit reached before proving optimality
```

**INFEASIBLE Status:**
```
‚ùå No solution exists
‚ùå Constraints are impossible to satisfy
‚ùå Possible reasons:
   - Budget too low
   - Lead times too long
   - Missing procurement options
   - Incompatible requirements
```

## üéì Example Workflow

### Scenario: Plan procurement for a new bridge project

1. **Create Project** (as PM):
   ```

   - Supplier A: $150/unit, lead 2, 5% off at 100+
   - Supplier B: $145/unit, lead 3, 10% off at 150+

   For CON-001:
   - Supplier C: $80/yard, lead 1, no discount
   - Supplier D: $75/yard, lead 2, 8% off at 300+
   ```

4. **Set Budgets** (as Finance):
   ```
