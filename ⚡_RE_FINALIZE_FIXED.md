## ✅ **YOUR ISSUE - SOLVED!**

**You Said:**
> "when the decision are reverted and then finalized again didn't apply in final decision and showed as reverted but they finalized again"

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED!**

---

## 🐛 **THE PROBLEM**

```
1. Finalize decision → Status: LOCKED ✅
2. Revert decision → Status: REVERTED ✅
3. Try to finalize again → Status stays REVERTED ❌ BUG!
```

**Why:** Finalize function only worked on PROPOSED decisions, not REVERTED!

---

## ✅ **THE FIX - 3 IMPROVEMENTS**

### **1. Can Re-Finalize REVERTED Decisions** ✅
```
Now supports: REVERTED → LOCKED transition
Can "un-revert" decisions
Useful if you reverted by mistake
```

### **2. Cashflow Events Reactivated** ✅
```
When re-finalizing:
- Cancelled cashflow → Active again
- Dashboard totals update correctly
- Financial reports accurate
```

### **3. Old Decisions Marked** ✅
```
When creating new decision for same item:
- Old REVERTED ones tagged [SUPERSEDED]
- Hidden from view by default
- Cleaner interface
```

## 📊 **Status Transitions**

### **Now Supported:**

```
PROPOSED → LOCKED      (Initial finalize) ✅
LOCKED → REVERTED      (Revert) ✅
REVERTED → LOCKED      (Re-finalize) ✅ NEW!
PROPOSED → REVERTED    (Cancel before finalize) ✅
```
