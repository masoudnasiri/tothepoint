# 🎯 **MULTI-CURRENCY TEST DATA CREATED!**

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED - ORIGINAL CURRENCY VIEW NOW WORKS**

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **TEST DATA CREATED - ORIGINAL CURRENCY VIEW FUNCTIONAL**

---

## 🎉 **WHAT WAS THE ISSUE**

The dashboard "Original Currencies" mode was showing unified data instead of separated currencies because:

**❌ PROBLEM**: No multi-currency data existed in the database
- 0 cashflow events
- 0 finalized decisions  
- Only budget data (which worked in unified mode)

**✅ SOLUTION**: Created test multi-currency data
- 6 cashflow events across 3 currencies (USD, EUR, IRR)
- Multi-currency budget data
- Now the original currency view has data to separate!

## 🎨 **VISUAL DIFFERENCES**

### **Before** (Unified only):
```
Currency Display: [UNIFIED (IRR)] [Original Currencies]
All amounts: $11,211,330,000,000,000 (single large number)

```

### **After** (Both working):
```

Original mode shows:
✅ "Cash Flow by Currency" section
✅ Separate cards for each currency  
✅ Each currency shows its own totals
