## üéØ Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: LOWEST_COST

**Objective:** Minimize total procurement cost

#### When to Use:
- Budget is the primary concern
- All projects have equal priority
- Cost savings are critical

#### Formula:
```
Minimize: Œ£ (unit_cost √ó quantity) for all items
```

#### Best Paired With:
- **GLOP** - for pure cost minimization
- **CP_SAT** - when you have discount rules

---

### Strategy 2: PRIORITY_WEIGHTED

**Objective:** Minimize weighted cost based on project priorities

#### When to Use:
- Projects have different importance levels
- High-priority projects should get preference
- Portfolio-level optimization

#### Formula:
```
Minimize: Œ£ (unit_cost √ó quantity √ó (11 - priority_weight))
```
*High priority (10) gets weight 1, low priority (1) gets weight 10*

#### Best Paired With:
- **CP_SAT** - handles priority weighting naturally
- **CBC** - for production portfolio optimization

---

### Strategy 3: FAST_DELIVERY

**Objective:** Minimize total delivery time

#### When to Use:
- Time to market is critical
- Project deadlines are tight
- Cost is secondary to speed

#### Formula:
```
Minimize: Œ£ (delivery_time √ó selection_variable)
```

#### Best Paired With:
- **CP_SAT** - best for time-based optimization
- **SCIP** - when combined with cost constraints

---

### Strategy 4: SMOOTH_CASHFLOW

**Objective:** Distribute spending evenly across time periods

#### When to Use:
- Cash flow stability is important
- Want to avoid spending spikes
- Budget is spread across periods

#### Formula:
```
Minimize: Variance of cash outflows across time periods
```

#### Best Paired With:
- **CP_SAT** - handles variance calculations
- **SCIP** - for complex cash flow rules

---

### Strategy 5: BALANCED

**Objective:** Balance cost, priority, and delivery time

#### When to Use:
- Multi-criteria decision making
- No single factor dominates
- Want well-rounded solutions

#### Formula:
```
Minimize: 0.7 √ó weighted_cost + 0.3 √ó delivery_time_factor
```

#### Best Paired With:
- **CP_SAT** - handles multiple objectives well
- **CBC** - for production multi-criteria optimization

---

## üî¨ Graph Algorithms Integration

### Critical Path Analysis

The system now builds a **dependency graph** for your projects and can identify the **critical path** - the longest sequence of dependent items.

#### Use Critical Path To:
1. **Identify bottlenecks** - which items delay the whole project
2. **Prioritize procurement** - focus on critical path items first
3. **Risk management** - monitor high-risk items
4. **Resource allocation** - assign best resources to critical items

#### API Endpoint:
```
GET /finance/optimization-analysis/{run_id}
```

#### Response Example:
```json
{
  "critical_path": ["P1_I001", "P1_I002", "P1_I005"],
  "critical_path_length": 3,
  "network_analysis": {
    "total_nodes": 45,
    "total_edges": 38,
    "connected_components": 3,
    "betweenness_centrality": {...}
  }
}
```

### Network Flow Analysis

Analyzes procurement as a **flow problem** through a network:

- **Nodes:** Project items
- **Edges:** Dependencies and sequences
- **Flow:** Budget and resources

#### Applications:
1. **Bottleneck detection** - find resource constraints
2. **Dependency mapping** - visualize item relationships
3. **Parallel procurement** - identify items that can be procured simultaneously
4. **Centrality analysis** - find most "important" items in the network

## üí° Usage Recommendations

### For Small Projects (< 50 items)

```
‚úÖ Solver: CP_SAT
‚úÖ Strategy: PRIORITY_WEIGHTED or BALANCED
‚úÖ Multiple Proposals: Yes
‚úÖ Time Limit: 60 seconds
```

**Why:** CP-SAT excels at small problems with complex constraints. Multiple proposals help you understand trade-offs.

---

### For Medium Projects (50-500 items)

```
‚úÖ Solver: CP_SAT or CBC
‚úÖ Strategy: Start with all strategies, then focus
‚úÖ Multiple Proposals: Yes for first run, No for subsequent
‚úÖ Time Limit: 300 seconds
```

**Why:** Balance between solution quality and speed. Use proposals to explore options, then commit to one strategy.

---

### For Large Projects (500+ items)

```
‚úÖ Solver: GLOP or CBC
‚úÖ Strategy: LOWEST_COST or PRIORITY_WEIGHTED
‚úÖ Multiple Proposals: No (too expensive)
‚úÖ Time Limit: 600 seconds
```

**Why:** Speed becomes critical. GLOP is fastest for linear problems, CBC for mixed-integer.

---

### For Time-Critical Situations

```
‚úÖ Solver: GLOP
‚úÖ Strategy: FAST_DELIVERY
‚úÖ Multiple Proposals: No
‚úÖ Time Limit: 60 seconds

## üéì Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Then Optimize

```
1. First run: CP_SAT with all strategies ‚Üí understand your problem
2. Second run: Choose best strategy, single proposal ‚Üí refine
3. Production: Selected solver + strategy ‚Üí fast execution
```

### 2. Use Time Limits Wisely

- **Development:** 60-120 seconds for quick iterations
- **Analysis:** 300-600 seconds for thorough exploration
- **Production:** 120-300 seconds for balanced speed/quality

### 3. Monitor Solution Quality

```python
if proposal.status == "OPTIMAL":
    # Use this solution
elif proposal.status == "FEASIBLE":
    # Consider increasing time_limit_seconds
else:
    # Problem may be infeasible - check constraints
```

### 4. Leverage Multiple Proposals

Use different strategies for different stakeholders:
- **CFO:** LOWEST_COST proposal
- **Operations:** FAST_DELIVERY proposal
- **Management:** BALANCED proposal

### 5. Understand Your Problem Type

**Linear Problem?** ‚Üí Use GLOP  
**Complex Constraints?** ‚Üí Use CP_SAT  
**Production MIP?** ‚Üí Use CBC  
**Research?** ‚Üí Use SCIP or compare all

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Solver Returns INFEASIBLE

**Solutions:**
1. Check budget constraints - may be too tight
2. Verify all items have valid delivery options
3. Review locked decisions - they may conflict
4. Try different time_limit_seconds
5. Use GLOP for quick feasibility check

### Problem: Solutions Take Too Long

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce `time_limit_seconds`
2. Switch to GLOP for faster solutions
3. Disable `generate_multiple_proposals`
4. Reduce `max_time_slots`

### Problem: GLOP Solutions Not Optimal

**Explanation:** GLOP uses LP relaxation with rounding

**Solutions:**
1. Use CP_SAT or CBC for true integer optimization
2. Accept small optimality gap for speed
3. Use GLOP for initial feasibility, then refine with CBC

### Problem: Different Solvers Give Different Results

**Explanation:** This is normal!

- GLOP rounds LP relaxation ‚Üí approximate
- CP_SAT, SCIP, CBC all find true optimal ‚Üí may differ due to tie-breaking
- Different strategies ‚Üí different objectives
