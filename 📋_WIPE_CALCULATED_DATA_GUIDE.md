## üéØ **When to Use This**

### **Use Cases:**

**1. Fresh Start with Same Setup**
```
Scenario: Completed Phase 1, want to optimize Phase 2
         Keep all projects/procurement options
         Delete old results to start fresh

Action: Run wipe script
Result: Can run new optimizations without old data interfering
```

**2. Testing Different Strategies**
```
Scenario: Want to test different optimization strategies
         Keep base data (projects, options, budgets)
         Clear previous results

Action: Run wipe script
Result: Clean slate for new optimization tests
```

**3. Fixing Mistakes**
```
Scenario: Made wrong decisions, want to redo
         Keep project setup
         Clear all decisions and cashflow

Action: Run wipe script
Result: Start decision-making process from scratch
```

**4. New Budget Period**
```
Scenario: New fiscal quarter/month
         Same projects and options
         Clear old financial events

Action: Run wipe script + Update budgets
Result: Fresh financial tracking
```

---

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **Quick Start:**

```powershell
# Run the wipe script
.\wipe_calculated_data.bat
```

**It will ask for confirmation TWICE:**

```
Step 1: Type 'WIPE RESULTS' (case-sensitive)
Step 2: Type 'YES' to proceed
```

**Then:**
- ‚úÖ Deletes all calculated data
- ‚úÖ Shows count of deleted records
- ‚úÖ Confirms what was kept

---

## üìä **What Happens - Step by Step**

### **1. Confirmation:**
```
You run: .\wipe_calculated_data.bat

Prompt 1: "Type 'WIPE RESULTS' to confirm"
You type: WIPE RESULTS

Prompt 2: "Type 'YES' to proceed"
You type: YES
```

### **2. Deletion Process:**
```
Script connects to database...

Deleting cashflow_events...
‚úÖ Deleted 150 rows from Cashflow Events

Deleting finalized_decisions...
‚úÖ Deleted 45 rows from Finalized Decisions

Deleting optimization_results...
‚úÖ Deleted 45 rows from Optimization Results

Deleting optimization_runs...
‚úÖ Deleted 5 rows from Optimization Runs

‚úÖ Successfully wiped 245 calculated records!
```

### **3. Verification:**
```
DELETED:
  - All optimization runs and results
  - All finalized decisions
  - All cashflow events

KEPT (Unchanged):
  - Users
  - Projects, Project Items, Delivery Options
  - Procurement Options
  - Budget Data
  - Decision Factor Weights

You can now run fresh optimizations!
```

---

## üß™ **How to Verify**

### **Before Running Wipe:**

```powershell
# Check counts
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d procurement_dss

# Run these queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM optimization_runs;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM finalized_decisions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cashflow_events;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM procurement_options;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM budget_data;
```

**Example Output:**
```
optimization_runs:      5
finalized_decisions:   45
cashflow_events:      150
projects:              10  ‚Üê Should stay
procurement_options:   75  ‚Üê Should stay
budget_data:           12  ‚Üê Should stay
```

### **After Running Wipe:**

Run same queries:

**Expected Result:**
```
optimization_runs:      0  ‚Üê DELETED ‚úÖ
finalized_decisions:    0  ‚Üê DELETED ‚úÖ
cashflow_events:        0  ‚Üê DELETED ‚úÖ
projects:              10  ‚Üê KEPT ‚úÖ
procurement_options:   75  ‚Üê KEPT ‚úÖ
budget_data:           12  ‚Üê KEPT ‚úÖ
```

---

## üé® **Dashboard After Wipe**

### **What You'll See:**

**Dashboard Page:**
```
Total Budget: $500,000 ‚úÖ (Kept)
Total Inflow:  $0      ‚úÖ (Events deleted)
Total Outflow: $0      ‚úÖ (Events deleted)
Net Position:  $500,000 ‚úÖ (Correct)
```

**Finalized Decisions Page:**
```
No finalized decisions found ‚úÖ (All deleted)
```

**Optimization Page:**
```
No previous runs ‚úÖ (History deleted)
```

**Projects Page:**
```
All your projects still there ‚úÖ (Kept)
All project items still there ‚úÖ (Kept)
All delivery options still there ‚úÖ (Kept)
```

**Procurement Page:**
```
All procurement options still there ‚úÖ (Kept)
All supplier info still there ‚úÖ (Kept)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **1. This is NOT Reversible!**

```
Once you wipe:
- ‚ùå Deleted data CANNOT be recovered
- ‚ùå No "undo" button
- ‚úÖ But you can re-run optimizations
- ‚úÖ Base data is safe
```

**Recommendation:** Create backup first!
```powershell
.\backup_database.bat
```

### **2. Order Matters (Foreign Keys)**

```
The script deletes in correct order:
1. cashflow_events (references decisions)
2. finalized_decisions (references optimization_runs)
3. optimization_results (references optimization_runs)
4. optimization_runs (parent table)

This prevents foreign key constraint errors ‚úÖ
```

### **3. Bunch Management Data**

```
Finalized decisions include:
- bunch_id
- bunch_name

These are also deleted ‚úÖ
You'll need to create new bunches after re-optimization
```

---

## üîÑ **Workflow After Wipe**

```
1. Run wipe script
   .\wipe_calculated_data.bat
   
2. Verify data (optional)
   Check dashboard - should show $0 inflow/outflow
   
3. Run new optimization
   Navigate to: Advanced Optimization
   Select strategy
   Run optimization
   
4. Save results
   Review proposals
   Save as decisions
   
5. Finalize
   Lock decisions
   Cashflow events created
   
6. Dashboard updated
   Shows new financial data
```

## üìö **Files Created**

```
‚úÖ backend/wipe_calculated_data.py
   - Python script to wipe data
   - Runs inside Docker container
   - Safe deletion with logging

‚úÖ wipe_calculated_data.bat
   - Windows batch script
   - Double confirmation required
   - Easy to run

‚úÖ üìã_WIPE_CALCULATED_DATA_GUIDE.md (This file)
   - Complete documentation
   - Usage guide
   - Safety information
```

---

## üí° **Safety Features**

### **1. Double Confirmation**
```
Requires two separate confirmations:
1. Type exact phrase: "WIPE RESULTS"
2. Type exact phrase: "YES"

Prevents accidental deletion ‚úÖ
```

### **2. Clear Logging**
```
Shows exactly what's being deleted:
- Table name
- Number of rows
- Success/failure

Full transparency ‚úÖ
```

### **3. Transaction Safety**
```
Uses database transaction:
- If any error occurs ‚Üí Rollback all changes
- All-or-nothing operation

Data integrity guaranteed ‚úÖ
```

### **4. Keep Base Data**
```
Only deletes from specific tables:
- optimization_runs
- optimization_results
- finalized_decisions
- cashflow_events

Never touches:
- users
- projects
- project_items
- delivery_options
- procurement_options
- budget_data

Your setup is safe ‚úÖ
```

---

## üöÄ **Quick Commands**

### **Wipe Calculated Data:**
```powershell
.\wipe_calculated_data.bat
```

### **Backup Before Wipe (Recommended):**
```powershell
.\backup_database.bat
.\wipe_calculated_data.bat
```

### **Check What Will Be Deleted:**
```powershell
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d procurement_dss -c "
SELECT 
  'optimization_runs' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM optimization_runs
UNION ALL
SELECT 'optimization_results', COUNT(*) FROM optimization_results
UNION ALL
SELECT 'finalized_decisions', COUNT(*) FROM finalized_decisions
UNION ALL
SELECT 'cashflow_events', COUNT(*) FROM cashflow_events;
"
```

### **Verify After Wipe:**
```powershell
# Should all show 0
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d procurement_dss -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) as cashflow_events_count FROM cashflow_events;
"
```
