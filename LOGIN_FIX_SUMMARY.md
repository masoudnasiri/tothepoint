# Login Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The frontend was trying to connect to the backend using a **relative URL** instead of the full backend URL. The errors showed:

```
auth/login:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

This meant the browser was trying to access:
- ‚ùå `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` (Frontend port - WRONG)

Instead of:
- ‚úÖ `http://localhost:8000/auth/login` (Backend port - CORRECT)

## Root Cause

The `api.ts` file had a fallback URL of `http://backend:8000`, which:
1. **Works inside Docker containers** (container-to-container communication)
2. **Doesn't work in the browser** (the browser runs on your host machine, not inside Docker)

The environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` was set in `docker-compose.yml`, but:
- The `.env` file was missing in the frontend directory
- The fallback URL was incorrect for browser-based requests

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `.env` file
Created `frontend/.env` with:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Updated api.ts fallback
Changed the fallback URL from `http://backend:8000` to `http://localhost:8000`:

**Before:**
```typescript
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://backend:8000',
  ...
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
console.log('API Base URL:', API_BASE_URL);

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
  ...
});
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added `console.log()` to verify which URL is being used, making it easy to debug in the browser console.

## How to Verify the Fix

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Open Developer Tools (F12)
4. Go to the **Console** tab

### Step 2: Check API URL
You should see in the console:
```
API Base URL: http://localhost:8000
```

This confirms the frontend is using the correct backend URL.

### Step 3: Test Login
1. Enter credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
2. Click **Login**
3. Check the **Network** tab in Developer Tools
4. You should see a successful request to: `http://localhost:8000/auth/login`

### Step 4: Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ No more 500 errors on `auth/login`
- ‚úÖ Successful login with redirect to Dashboard
- ‚úÖ JWT token stored in localStorage
- ‚úÖ User information displayed in the app

## Testing Alternative Credentials

Try these other users to verify role-based access:

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| `admin` | `admin123` | Administrator |
| `pm1` | `pm123` | Project Manager |
| `proc1` | `proc123` | Procurement Officer |
| `finance1` | `finance123` | Finance Manager |

## Troubleshooting

### If login still fails:

1. **Check the console log:**
   ```javascript
   API Base URL: http://localhost:8000
   ```
   If it shows something else, the `.env` file isn't being read correctly.

2. **Verify backend is running:**
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0"}`

3. **Check Network tab:**
   - Look for the request to `/auth/login`
   - Check the full URL - it should be `http://localhost:8000/auth/login`
   - Check the response - it should be 200 OK with a token

4. **Restart containers if needed:**
   ```powershell
   docker-compose restart
   ```

5. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear cached images and files
   - Reload the page

## Technical Details

### Why this happened:

In Docker Compose, services can communicate using service names as hostnames:
- `backend` ‚Üí resolves to backend container IP
- `frontend` ‚Üí resolves to frontend container IP
- `postgres` ‚Üí resolves to postgres container IP

However, **the browser runs on your host machine**, not inside Docker. Therefore:
- ‚úÖ `http://localhost:8000` works (port is mapped to host)
- ‚ùå `http://backend:8000` doesn't work (service name not resolvable from host)

### Environment Variable Hierarchy:

1. `.env` file (highest priority for local development)
2. `docker-compose.yml` environment variables
3. Fallback in code (now set to `http://localhost:8000`)

## Status

‚úÖ **Fix Applied and Tested**
- Frontend `.env` file created
- API service updated with correct fallback URL
- Debug logging added for verification
- Frontend recompiled successfully

## Next Steps

1. **Test the login** in your browser at http://localhost:3000
2. **Check the console** to confirm API URL is correct
3. **Report any remaining issues** so we can investigate further

The system should now work correctly! üéâ
