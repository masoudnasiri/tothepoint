# ✅ Dual Cash Flow System - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

The comprehensive dual cash flow tracking system has been successfully implemented, separating **Forecasted** cash flow (planning-based) from **Actual** cash flow (real data from finance team).

---

## 📊 Features Implemented

### 1. **Forecasted Cash Flow System**
- **Source**: Delivery Options configured during project planning
- **Purpose**: Financial forecasting and budget planning
- **Automatic Creation**: FORECAST cashflow events created when decisions are finalized
- **Data Includes**:
  - Predicted invoice timing (ABSOLUTE or RELATIVE)
  - Expected invoice amounts
  - Delivery dates and payment schedules

### 2. **Actual Cash Flow System**
- **Source**: Real invoice data entered by finance team
- **Purpose**: Track actual financial performance
- **Manual Entry**: Finance team enters data through dedicated UI
- **Data Includes**:
  - Actual invoice issue dates
  - Real invoice amounts
  - Payment received dates
  - Invoice notes and references

### 3. **Comparison & Variance Analysis**
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: View forecast vs actual in same dashboard
- **Variance Metrics**: 
  - Inflow variance (revenue differences)
  - Outflow variance (cost differences)
  - Net position variance (overall impact)
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded favorable/unfavorable variances
