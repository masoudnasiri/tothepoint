# 🔓 PMO Project Access - FIXED!

## ✅ **YOUR ISSUE - RESOLVED!**

**You Said:**
> "the pmo should see list of all project in filter and all project in project page but it didn't"

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED!**

---

## 🐛 **THE PROBLEM**

**What Was Wrong:**
```
PMO User Logged In:
├─ Navigate to Projects page
├─ Expected: See ALL projects
├─ Actual: Only saw assigned projects (like PM) ❌
│
├─ Dashboard filter dropdown
├─ Expected: See ALL projects
└─ Actual: Only saw assigned projects ❌
```

**Root Cause:**

The `get_user_projects()` function in `backend/app/auth.py` didn't include PMO role:

```python
# OLD CODE (Broken):
async def get_user_projects(db: AsyncSession, user: User) -> list[int]:
    if user.role == "admin":
        return all_projects  # ✅ Admin sees all
    elif user.role == "pm":
        return assigned_projects  # PM sees assigned
    else:
        return []  # ❌ PMO got empty list!
```

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

**File:** `backend/app/auth.py`

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```python
async def get_user_projects(db: AsyncSession, user: User) -> list[int]:
    if user.role == "admin":
        # Admin can see all projects
        result = await db.execute(select(Project.id)...)
        return [row[0] for row in result.fetchall()]
    elif user.role == "pm":
        # PM can only see assigned projects
        result = await db.execute(select(ProjectAssignment.project_id)...)
        return [row[0] for row in result.fetchall()]
    else:
        return []  # ❌ PMO got empty list!
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```python
async def get_user_projects(db: AsyncSession, user: User) -> list[int]:
    if user.role in ["admin", "pmo"]:  # ✅ Added PMO!
        # Admin and PMO can see all projects
        result = await db.execute(select(Project.id)...)
        return [row[0] for row in result.fetchall()]
    elif user.role == "pm":
        # PM can only see assigned projects
        result = await db.execute(select(ProjectAssignment.project_id)...)
        return [row[0] for row in result.fetchall()]
    else:
        return []
```

**Also Updated:**
```python
def can_access_project(user: User, project_id: int, user_projects: list[int]) -> bool:
    if user.role in ["admin", "pmo", "procurement", "finance"]:  # ✅ Added PMO
        return True
    elif user.role == "pm":
        return project_id in user_projects
    return False
```
