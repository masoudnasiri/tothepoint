## 🔧 **Known Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: `DELL-STR-001` Still Shows After Marking as Final Invoice

**Root Cause**: The `is_final_invoice` field might not be included in the API response, or the frontend filtering is not working correctly.

**Solution Steps**:
1. Backend has been restarted to ensure the new field is properly loaded
2. The field should now be included in the API response
3. Frontend filtering logic checks for `decision.is_final_invoice === true`

**How to Test**:
1. Create an invoice for `DELL-STR-001`
2. Check the "Final Invoice" checkbox
3. Submit the invoice
4. Refresh the page
5. Try to create a new invoice - `DELL-STR-001` should NOT appear in the dropdown

### Issue 2: Auto-selection When "Complete Payment" is Selected

**Current Behavior**: The decision dropdown is NOT disabled or auto-selected when "Complete Payment" is chosen.

**Expected Behavior**: Users should be able to freely select any available decision regardless of payment status.

**If Issue Persists**:
- The payment status dropdown only updates the `payment_terms` field
- It does NOT auto-select or disable the decision dropdown
- Users can change the selected decision at any time

## 📊 **Business Logic**

| Scenario | Final Invoice Checked? | Item Behavior |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Regular Invoice** | ❌ No | Item remains in dropdown for additional invoices |
| **Final Invoice** | ✅ Yes | Item disappears from dropdown permanently |
| **Fully Paid Item** | N/A | Item excluded regardless of invoice status |

## 🚀 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Create regular invoice for an item → Item still appears in dropdown
- [ ] Create final invoice for an item → Item disappears from dropdown
- [ ] Try to create another invoice for final-invoiced item → Get error message
- [ ] View invoice history → All invoices are visible
- [ ] Change payment status → Decision dropdown remains enabled and changeable

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

If `is_final_invoice` filtering is not working:

1. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, item_code, is_final_invoice FROM finalized_decisions WHERE item_code = 'DELL-STR-001';
   ```

2. **Check API Response**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Create invoice → Check the POST request payload
   - Refresh decisions list → Check if `is_final_invoice` field is in the response

3. **Check Frontend Filtering**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Console
   - Add: `console.log('Decisions:', decisions)` in `fetchDecisions` function
   - Check if `is_final_invoice` field is present in the decision objects

## 📝 **Files Modified**
