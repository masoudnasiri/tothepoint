## 🧪 **TESTING MULTI-CURRENCY FEATURES**

### **Test 1: View Currencies**:
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Login as admin
3. Go to Finance → Currency Management
4. ✅ Should see 10 active currencies
5. ✅ Should see exchange rates tab
```

### **Test 2: Create Multi-Currency Procurement**:
```
1. Create a new project
2. Add items to the project
3. Create procurement options:
   - Option 1: $1,000 USD
   - Option 2: €850 EUR  
   - Option 3: ﷼45,000,000 IRR
4. Verify data saves with currency codes
```

### **Test 3: Run Optimization**:
```
1. With mixed-currency options created
2. Run optimization
3. Backend converts all to IRR automatically
4. Check logs: docker-compose logs backend | Select-String "Converted"
5. Verify optimization results
```

### **Test 4: Currency Conversion**:
```
Example conversions with current rates:
- $1,000 USD = ﷼47,600,000 IRR (rate: 47,600)
- €850 EUR = ﷼48,110,000 IRR (rate: 56,600)
