## 💾 Database Persistence Flow

### 1. During Optimization (Automatic)

```python
# When optimization completes:

✅ SAVED TO: optimization_runs
{
    run_id: UUID,
    run_timestamp: DateTime,
    request_parameters: {
        solver_type: "CP_SAT",
        max_time_slots: 12,
        proposals_count: 5,
        strategies: [...]
    },
    status: "SUCCESS"
}

✅ SAVED TO: optimization_results (25 rows)
{
    run_id: UUID (same as above),
    project_id: 1,
    item_code: "ITEM-001",
    procurement_option_id: 5,
    purchase_time: 2,
    delivery_time: 3,
    quantity: 100,
    final_cost: 5000.00
}
...
```

### 2. When Saving Proposal (User Click)

```python
# When user clicks "Save Proposal as Decisions":

✅ SAVED TO: finalized_decisions (25 rows)
{
    run_id: UUID (links to optimization_runs),
    project_item_id: 101,
    item_code: "ITEM-001",
    procurement_option_id: 5,
    purchase_date: "2025-11-01",
    delivery_date: "2025-12-01",
    quantity: 100,
    final_cost: 5000.00,
    status: "PROPOSED", ← Not locked yet!
    decision_maker_id: 1,
    is_manual_edit: false
}
...

✅ SAVED TO: cashflow_events (50 rows)
# OUTFLOWS (25 rows)
{
    related_decision_id: 1,
    event_type: "OUTFLOW",
    forecast_type: "FORECAST",
    event_date: "2025-11-01",
    amount: 5000.00,
    description: "Payment for ITEM-001"
}
...

# INFLOWS (25 rows)
{
    related_decision_id: 1,
    event_type: "INFLOW",
    forecast_type: "FORECAST",
    event_date: "2025-12-31",
    amount: 5000.00,
    description: "Revenue from ITEM-001"
}
...
```

### 3. When Finalizing (User Click)

```python
# When user clicks "Finalize & Lock":

✅ UPDATED IN: finalized_decisions
{
    status: "PROPOSED" → "LOCKED", ← Changed!
    finalized_at: "2025-10-09 14:35:00", ← Added!
    finalized_by_id: 1 ← Added!
}

✅ IMPACT ON: Future optimizations
# During next optimization run:
locked_items = SELECT WHERE status = 'LOCKED'
project_items = all_items - locked_items
# Locked items excluded from optimization!
```

## 🚀 Complete User Workflow

### **The Full Journey:**

```
DAY 1: Initial Optimization
├─ 09:00 - Run optimization (CP_SAT, 5 proposals)
│         ├─ Backend saves run to optimization_runs ✅
│         └─ Backend saves results to optimization_results ✅
├─ 09:05 - Review all 5 proposals
├─ 09:10 - Select "Balanced Strategy"
├─ 09:15 - Edit 2 items, remove 1, add 1
├─ 09:20 - Click "Save Proposal as Decisions"
│         ├─ Backend creates 25 finalized_decisions (PROPOSED) ✅
│         └─ Backend creates 50 cashflow_events (FORECAST) ✅
└─ 09:25 - See "Finalize & Lock" button appear

DAY 2: Management Review
├─ 10:00 - Team reviews saved decisions in "Finalized Decisions" page
├─ 10:30 - Adjustments needed for 3 items
├─ 10:45 - Click "Finalize & Lock" for 22 confirmed items
│         └─ Backend updates 22 decisions to LOCKED ✅
└─ 11:00 - 3 items still PROPOSED (will re-optimize)

DAY 3: Re-optimization
├─ 14:00 - Run new optimization
│         ├─ Backend loads data
│         ├─ Excludes 22 locked items ✅
│         ├─ Optimizes only 3 remaining + any new items
│         ├─ Saves new run to optimization_runs ✅
│         └─ Saves new results ✅
├─ 14:05 - Review proposals for 3 items
├─ 14:10 - Save and finalize remaining 3 items
│         └─ Now all 25 items LOCKED ✅
└─ 14:15 - Complete! ✅

WEEK 2: Historical Analysis
├─ Click "Previous Runs (3)"
│  └─ See all 3 optimization runs
├─ Review what was optimized each time
├─ Compare costs across runs

## 🔄 Data Flow Summary

### **Optimization → Database**

```python
# Automatic during optimization:
run_optimization()
  ├─ Generates proposals
  ├─ _save_optimization_run()
  │   └─ INSERT INTO optimization_runs
  └─ _save_optimization_results()
      └─ INSERT INTO optimization_results (25 rows)
```

### **Proposal → Finalized Decisions**

```python
# When user saves proposal:
POST /decisions/save-proposal
  ├─ For each decision:
  │   ├─ INSERT INTO finalized_decisions (status: PROPOSED)
  │   ├─ INSERT INTO cashflow_events (OUTFLOW, FORECAST)
  │   └─ INSERT INTO cashflow_events (INFLOW, FORECAST)
  └─ Return saved_count
```

### **Proposed → Locked**

```python
# When user finalizes:
POST /decisions/finalize
  └─ UPDATE finalized_decisions
      SET status = 'LOCKED',
          finalized_at = NOW(),
          finalized_by_id = user.id
      WHERE id IN (decision_ids)
```

### **Locked → Excluded from Future Runs**

```python
# Next optimization automatically:
_load_data()
  ├─ locked_items = SELECT WHERE status = 'LOCKED'
  └─ project_items = all_items - locked_items
      └─ Optimization only processes unlocked items!
```

## 📊 Database Verification Queries

### Check Optimization Runs Saved
```sql
SELECT 
    run_id,
    run_timestamp,
    status,
    request_parameters->>'solver_type' as solver,
    request_parameters->>'proposals_count' as proposals
FROM optimization_runs
ORDER BY run_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected: See your optimization runs with metadata
```

### Check Optimization Results Saved
```sql
SELECT 
    run_id,
    COUNT(*) as results_count,
    SUM(final_cost) as total_cost
FROM optimization_results
GROUP BY run_id
ORDER BY MAX(run_timestamp) DESC;

-- Expected: See results count and total cost per run
```

### Check Finalized Decisions Created
```sql
SELECT 
    run_id,
    status,
    COUNT(*) as decision_count,
    SUM(final_cost) as total_cost
FROM finalized_decisions
WHERE run_id = 'YOUR_RUN_ID'
GROUP BY run_id, status;

-- Expected: See PROPOSED or LOCKED decisions
```

### Check Cashflow Events Generated
```sql
SELECT 
    fd.item_code,
    ce.event_type,
    ce.forecast_type,
    ce.event_date,
    ce.amount
FROM cashflow_events ce
JOIN finalized_decisions fd ON ce.related_decision_id = fd.id
WHERE fd.run_id = 'YOUR_RUN_ID'
ORDER BY ce.event_date;

-- Expected: See OUTFLOW and INFLOW events
```

### Verify Locked Items Excluded
```sql
-- Locked items
SELECT project_id, item_code, status 
FROM finalized_decisions 
WHERE status = 'LOCKED';

-- Next optimization should exclude these
-- Check backend logs: "Excluded X locked items from optimization"
```

## 📞 Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: Optimization doesn't save to database
**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM optimization_runs ORDER BY run_timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
```
**Solution:** Verify backend logs, check database connection

### Problem: Can't save proposal
**Check:** Backend logs for errors
**Solution:** Ensure project items exist for all item codes

### Problem: "Finalize & Lock" button doesn't appear
**Check:** Did you click "Save Proposal as Decisions" first?
**Solution:** Must save before you can finalize

### Problem: Locked items still appearing in optimization
**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM finalized_decisions WHERE status = 'LOCKED';
```
**Solution:** Verify status is actually 'LOCKED' (not 'PROPOSED')
