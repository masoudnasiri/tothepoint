# Admin Permissions Fix - Complete Access Granted

## Issue
When logged in as **admin**, users could not access or modify data in:
- **Finance Page** (Budget Management)
- **Procurement Page** (Supplier Options)

The UI buttons and action icons were hidden for admin users because the role checks only looked for specific roles ('finance', 'procurement') and didn't include 'admin'.

---

## Root Cause

The **frontend** had hardcoded role checks that excluded admin:

### ❌ Before (Broken)
```typescript
{user?.role === 'finance' && (
  <Button>Add Budget</Button>
)}

{user?.role === 'procurement' && (
  <Button>Add Option</Button>
)}
```

This meant admin users saw **read-only** pages without any buttons to create, edit, or delete data.

---

## Solution

Updated **all frontend role checks** to explicitly include admin role:

### ✅ After (Fixed)
```typescript
{(user?.role === 'finance' || user?.role === 'admin') && (
  <Button>Add Budget</Button>
)}

{(user?.role === 'procurement' || user?.role === 'admin') && (
  <Button>Add Option</Button>
)}
```

---

## Files Changed

### 1. `frontend/src/pages/FinancePage.tsx`
**Changes (2 locations):**
- ✅ Top action buttons (Add Budget, Import, Export, Download Template)
- ✅ Table row action buttons (Edit, Delete for each budget entry)

**Before:**
```typescript
{user?.role === 'finance' && (
  // ... action buttons
)}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{(user?.role === 'finance' || user?.role === 'admin') && (
  // ... action buttons
)}
```

---

### 2. `frontend/src/pages/ProcurementPage.tsx`
**Changes (2 locations):**
- ✅ Top action buttons (Add Option, Import, Export, Download Template)
- ✅ Table row action buttons (Edit, Delete for each procurement option)

**Before:**
```typescript
{user?.role === 'procurement' && (
  // ... action buttons
)}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{(user?.role === 'procurement' || user?.role === 'admin') && (
  // ... action buttons
)}
```

---

## Backend Permissions

The **backend** permissions were already correct (from Phase 4):

✅ `backend/app/auth.py`:
```python
def require_pm():
    """Require project manager or admin role"""
    return require_role(["pm", "admin"])

def require_procurement():
    """Require procurement specialist or admin role"""
    return require_role(["procurement", "admin"])

def require_finance():
    """Require finance user or admin role"""
    return require_role(["finance", "admin"])
```

So the backend was accepting admin requests, but the frontend was hiding the UI controls!

   - ✅ Import/Export/Template buttons visible
