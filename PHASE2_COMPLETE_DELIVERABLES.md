## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Date Handling ✅
**Library:** `@mui/x-date-pickers` with `date-fns`

**Format Conversion:**
- Frontend displays: User-friendly format (MM/DD/YYYY)
- API communication: ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Storage: PostgreSQL DATE type

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Convert to API format
newValue.toISOString().split('T')[0]

// Display in UI
new Date(item.required_by_date).toLocaleDateString()
```

---

### State Management ✅
**Pattern:** Local component state with React hooks

**Example:**
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  phase_name: '',
  start_date: new Date(),
  end_date: new Date(),
});
```

---

### API Integration ✅
**Pattern:** Service-based architecture

**Example:**
```typescript
// In component
const response = await phasesAPI.listByProject(projectId);
setPhases(response.data);

// In api.ts
phasesAPI: {
  listByProject: (projectId) => api.get(`/phases/project/${projectId}`)
}
```
