# 🔧 PM Reports Access Fix

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🚨 **PROBLEM**

**Error**: When PM users tried to access the "Reports & Analytics" page, they received a 500 Internal Server Error

**Root Cause**: The reports router was trying to access `current_user.assigned_projects`, which is a SQLAlchemy relationship that is not loaded by default

**Stack Trace**:
```
AttributeError: 'User' object has no attribute 'assigned_projects'
at /app/app/routers/reports.py, line 591
```

---

## 🔧 **SOLUTION**

### **Changed**: `backend/app/routers/reports.py`

#### **1. Added Import**
```python
from app.auth import get_current_user, get_user_projects  # Added get_user_projects
```

#### **2. Fixed PM Project Filtering (3 occurrences)**

**Before** (Lines 591, 642, 784):
```python
if current_user.role == 'pm':
    user_project_ids = [p.id for p in current_user.assigned_projects]  # ❌ ERROR
```

**After**:
```python
if current_user.role == 'pm':
    user_project_ids = await get_user_projects(db, current_user)  # ✅ FIXED
```

---

## 📋 **FILES MODIFIED**

1. `backend/app/routers/reports.py`
   - Line 18: Added `get_user_projects` import
   - Line 591: Fixed PM filtering in `get_reports_data()`
   - Line 642: Fixed PM filtering in `export_reports_excel()`
   - Lines 783-793: Fixed PM filtering in `get_projects_for_filter()`

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION**

### **What PM Users Can Now See:**
1. ✅ **Their Assigned Projects Only**: PM users only see data from projects they are assigned to
2. ✅ **Project Items**: Only items from their projects
3. ✅ **Reports & Analytics**: Financial summaries, EVM analytics filtered to their projects
4. ✅ **No Procurement Data**: PM users do NOT see:
   - Global procurement options
   - Other projects' procurement decisions
   - Global supplier information
   - Cost data from projects they're not assigned to

### **What PM Users CANNOT See:**
- ❌ Procurement options from other projects
- ❌ Supplier pricing information from other projects
- ❌ Financial data from projects they're not assigned to
- ❌ Global optimization results
- ❌ System-wide budget allocations

## 🎯 **ROLE-BASED DATA ACCESS**

| Role | Projects Visible | Procurement Data | Reports Access |
|------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **PM** | Assigned projects only | Only their project items | Filtered to assigned projects |
| **PMO** | All projects | All data | All data |
| **Procurement** | All projects | All procurement options | All data |
| **Finance** | All projects | All financial data | All data |
| **Admin** | All projects | All data | All data |

## 📊 **PM WORKFLOW**

### **What PM Users Can Do:**
1. ✅ **View Their Projects**: See only projects they are assigned to
2. ✅ **Manage Project Items**: Create, edit, delete items in their projects
3. ✅ **View Reports**: See analytics filtered to their assigned projects
4. ✅ **Track Progress**: Monitor their project's progress and status

### **What PM Users CANNOT Do:**
1. ❌ **View Other Projects**: Cannot see projects they're not assigned to
2. ❌ **Access Procurement**: Cannot see procurement options or supplier pricing
3. ❌ **Run Optimization**: Cannot access optimization engine
4. ❌ **Finalize Items**: Cannot finalize items (PMO role required)
5. ❌ **View Global Data**: Cannot see system-wide analytics

---

## 🔒 **SECURITY NOTES**

The fix ensures that:
1. ✅ **Data Isolation**: PM users only see data from their assigned projects
2. ✅ **Role Enforcement**: Procurement and financial data are hidden from PMs
3. ✅ **Project Assignment**: Projects are filtered based on `project_assignments` table
4. ✅ **Consistent Filtering**: All reports endpoints use the same filtering logic

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

PM users can now:
1. ✅ **Log in** to the platform
2. ✅ **Access Reports & Analytics** page
3. ✅ **View project statistics** for their assigned projects
4. ✅ **Filter reports** by their projects only
5. ✅ **Export reports** to Excel with filtered data

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND TESTED**  
**Impact**: PM users can now access Reports & Analytics page  
**Security**: Data isolation maintained correctly
