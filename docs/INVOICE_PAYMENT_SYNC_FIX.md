# 🔄 Invoice & Payment Data Sync Fix

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🚨 **PROBLEM**

1. **Data Isolation**: Invoice data entered in Procurement Plan vs Finalized Decisions pages were separate
2. **Missing Display**: Procurement Plan didn't show invoice status, payment status, or payment received information
3. **Currency Missing**: Invoice amounts shown without currency

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Data Storage:**
Both Procurement Plan and Finalized Decisions use the **SAME** `finalized_decisions` table, so data was already shared. The issue was:
- Backend not sending all invoice/payment fields
- Frontend not displaying the fields that were sent
- Currency information missing

### **What Was Missing:**

**Backend:**
- ✅ `actual_invoice_currency` (not sent)
- ✅ `actual_payment_amount` (not sent)
- ✅ `actual_payment_currency` (not sent)
- ✅ `actual_payment_date` (not sent)
- ✅ `payment_entered_by_id` (not sent)
- ✅ `payment_entered_at` (not sent)

**Frontend:**
- ✅ Type definitions for payment fields
- ✅ Invoice status column in table
- ✅ Payment status column in table
- ✅ Invoice details in view dialog
- ✅ Payment details in view dialog

---

## 🔧 **SOLUTION**

### **Backend: Send Complete Invoice & Payment Data**

**File: `backend/app/routers/procurement_plan.py`**

**Added fields (Lines 61-73):**
```python
# Invoice data (with currency support)
"actual_invoice_issue_date": decision.actual_invoice_issue_date,
"actual_invoice_amount": float(decision.actual_invoice_amount_value) if decision.actual_invoice_amount_value else ...,
"actual_invoice_currency": decision.actual_invoice_amount_currency or decision.final_cost_currency or 'IRR',
"actual_invoice_received_date": decision.actual_invoice_received_date,
"invoice_entered_by_id": decision.invoice_entered_by_id,
"invoice_entered_at": decision.invoice_entered_at,

# Payment data
"actual_payment_amount": float(decision.actual_payment_amount_value) if decision.actual_payment_amount_value else ...,
"actual_payment_currency": decision.actual_payment_amount_currency or decision.final_cost_currency or 'IRR',
"actual_payment_date": decision.actual_payment_date,
"payment_entered_by_id": decision.payment_entered_by_id,
"payment_entered_at": decision.payment_entered_at,
```

---

### **Frontend: Display Invoice & Payment Status**

**File 1: `frontend/src/types/index.ts`**

**Added fields:**
```typescript
export interface ProcurementPlanItem {
  // Invoice fields
  actual_invoice_amount?: number;
  actual_invoice_currency?: string;  // ✅ Added
  actual_invoice_issue_date?: string;
  actual_invoice_received_date?: string;
  
  // Payment fields
  actual_payment_amount?: number;  // ✅ Added
  actual_payment_currency?: string;  // ✅ Added
  actual_payment_date?: string;  // ✅ Added
  payment_entered_by_id?: number;  // ✅ Added
  payment_entered_at?: string;  // ✅ Added
}
```

**File 2: `frontend/src/pages/ProcurementPlanPage.tsx`**

**1. Added Table Columns:**
```typescript
<TableHead>
  <TableRow>
    {/* ... existing columns ... */}
    {isProcurementTeam && <TableCell>Invoice Status</TableCell>}  // ✅ Added
    {isProcurementTeam && <TableCell>Payment Status</TableCell>}  // ✅ Added
    <TableCell>Delivery Status</TableCell>
    <TableCell align="center">Actions</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
</TableHead>
```

**2. Added Status Chips in Table:**
```typescript
{/* Invoice Status */}
{isProcurementTeam && (
  <TableCell>
    {item.actual_invoice_issue_date ? (
      <Chip 
        label={`Invoiced (${formatCurrencyWithCode(item.actual_invoice_amount, item.actual_invoice_currency)})`}
        color="success"
        size="small"
      />
    ) : (
      <Chip label="Not Invoiced" color="default" size="small" />
    )}
  </TableCell>
)}

{/* Payment Status */}
{isProcurementTeam && (
  <TableCell>
    {item.actual_payment_date ? (
      <Chip 
        label={`Paid (${formatCurrencyWithCode(item.actual_payment_amount, item.actual_payment_currency)})`}
        color="success"
        size="small"
      />
    ) : (
      <Chip label="Not Paid" color="warning" size="small" />
    )}
  </TableCell>
)}
```

**3. Added Details in View Dialog:**
```typescript
{/* Invoice and Payment Information */}
{isProcurementTeam && (
  <>
    <Divider>Invoice & Payment Information</Divider>
    
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
      <Typography variant="subtitle2">Invoice Status</Typography>
      {selectedItem.actual_invoice_issue_date ? (
        <Box>
          <Chip label="Invoiced" color="success" />
          <Typography>Issue Date: {selectedItem.actual_invoice_issue_date}</Typography>
          <Typography>Amount: {formatCurrencyWithCode(...)}</Typography>
          <Typography>Received: {selectedItem.actual_invoice_received_date}</Typography>
        </Box>
      ) : (
        <Chip label="Not Invoiced" />
      )}
    </Grid>
    
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
      <Typography variant="subtitle2">Payment Status</Typography>
      {/* Similar structure for payment */}
    </Grid>
  </>
)}
```

## ✅ **DATA SYNCHRONIZATION**

### **How It Works:**

Both pages use the **SAME** database table (`finalized_decisions`), so:

1. ✅ **Enter invoice in Finalized Decisions** → Appears in Procurement Plan immediately
2. ✅ **Enter invoice in Procurement Plan** → Appears in Finalized Decisions immediately
3. ✅ **No duplicate data** - single source of truth
4. ✅ **Real-time sync** - both pages query the same table

### **Invoice Entry Points:**

| Page | Endpoint | Users |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Finalized Decisions** | `POST /decisions/{id}/actual-invoice` | Finance |
| **Procurement Plan** | `POST /procurement-plan/{id}/enter-invoice` | Procurement, Finance, Admin |

**Result**: Both update the same `finalized_decisions` record!

## 📊 **PROCUREMENT PLAN - NEW DISPLAY**

### **Table View (for Procurement/Finance/Admin):**

| Column | Shows | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Invoice Status | Invoiced / Not Invoiced | `Invoiced ($ 5,000.00)` |
| Payment Status | Paid / Not Paid | `Paid (IRR 1,000,000.00)` |
| Delivery Status | Awaiting / Confirmed / Complete | `Delivery Complete` |

### **Detail View (for Procurement/Finance/Admin):**

**Invoice Section:**
- Status: Invoiced / Not Invoiced (chip)
- Issue Date: 2025-11-15
- Amount: IRR 1,000,000.00 (with currency)
- Received Date: 2025-11-20

**Payment Section:**
- Status: Paid / Not Paid (chip)
- Payment Date: 2025-11-25
- Amount: IRR 1,000,000.00 (with currency)

## 🎯 **WORKFLOW**

### **Complete Invoice & Payment Flow:**

```
1. Procurement confirms delivery
   → Delivery Status: "Delivery Complete"
   
2. Finance/Procurement enters invoice
   (Either in Finalized Decisions OR Procurement Plan)
   → Invoice Status: "Invoiced (amount + currency)"
   → Visible in BOTH pages ✅
   
3. Finance enters payment
   (In Finalized Decisions page)
   → Payment Status: "Paid (amount + currency)"
   → Visible in BOTH pages ✅
```
