## CP-SAT Solver

### üéØ Full Name
**Constraint Programming with SAT (Boolean Satisfiability)**

### üìñ What Is It?

CP-SAT is Google's state-of-the-art constraint programming solver that uses **SAT (Boolean Satisfiability)** techniques under the hood. It's designed to solve **constraint satisfaction and optimization problems** with complex logical relationships.

### üîß How It Works

**1. Model Construction:**
```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Create variables
x = model.NewBoolVar('x')  # Binary variable
y = model.NewIntVar(0, 10, 'y')  # Integer variable

# Add constraints
model.Add(x + y <= 5)  # Linear constraint
model.AddBoolOr([x, y > 3])  # Logical constraint
```

**2. Constraint Propagation:**
- Reduces variable domains based on constraints
- Eliminates impossible combinations early
- Uses sophisticated propagation algorithms

**3. Search Strategy:**
- Uses Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)
- Learns from failures
- Backtracking with intelligent clause learning

**4. Solution Finding:**
- Explores search tree efficiently
- Prunes branches that can't lead to better solutions
- Guarantees optimality (if time permits)

### üí™ Strengths

**1. Handles Complex Constraints Naturally**
```python
# Example: "If we buy from supplier A, we must also buy item X"
model.AddImplication(buy_supplier_A, buy_item_X)

# Example: "Total quantity must be exactly divisible by pack size"
model.AddModuloEquality(0, total_quantity, pack_size)
```

**2. Non-Linear Relationships**
```python
# Bundling discounts (non-linear)
if quantity >= threshold:
    cost = base_cost * (1 - discount_percent)
```

**3. Logical Conditions**
```python
# All-or-nothing constraints
model.AddBoolOr([var1, var2, var3])  # At least one must be true
model.AddBoolAnd([var1, var2])  # Both must be true
```

**4. Automatically Handles Integer Variables**
- No LP relaxation needed
- True integer solutions
- No rounding issues

### ‚ö° Performance Characteristics

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst case: Exponential O(2^n)
- In practice: Much better due to:
  - Constraint propagation
  - Clause learning
  - Smart search strategies

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n √ó m) where n = variables, m = constraints
- Efficient memory usage
- Can handle medium-sized problems (100-1000 variables)

**Typical Performance (Your System):**
```
50 items, 10 options each, 12 time slots = ~6,000 variables
Expected time: 15-45 seconds
Solution quality: OPTIMAL
```

### üéØ Best Use Cases in Your System

**1. Complex Bundling Rules**
```python
# If quantity >= 100, discount applies to ALL units
# CP-SAT handles this naturally without linearization
```

**2. Payment Term Dependencies**
```python
# If payment is cash, must use specific suppliers
# Logical constraints are CP-SAT's strength
```

**3. Project Dependencies**
```python
# Item B can only be ordered after Item A is delivered
# Time-based dependencies handled well
```

**4. Capacity Constraints**
```python
# Supplier can handle max 5 items per period
# Resource constraints with CP-SAT
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

```python
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()

# Time limit
solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 300

# Parallelism
solver.parameters.num_search_workers = 8  # Use 8 cores

# Optimization focus
solver.parameters.linearization_level = 2  # More aggressive

# Preprocessing
solver.parameters.cp_model_presolve = True  # Enable preprocessing

# Logging
solver.parameters.log_search_progress = True
```

### üìä Real-World Example

**Your Procurement Scenario:**
```python
# Problem: 100 items, 5 procurement options each, 12 time periods
# Variables: 100 √ó 5 √ó 12 = 6,000 binary variables

# Constraints:
# - Each item procured exactly once
# - Budget limits per period
# - Lead times respected
# - Priority weights applied

# CP-SAT Solution:
# Time: 25-45 seconds
# Status: OPTIMAL
# Quality: True optimal solution
```

## GLOP Solver

### üéØ Full Name
**Google Linear Optimization Package**

### üìñ What Is It?

GLOP is Google's **Linear Programming (LP)** solver. It solves problems where:
- Objective is linear
- All constraints are linear
- Variables can be continuous

For integer problems (like yours), GLOP uses **LP relaxation** then rounds.

### üîß How It Works

**1. LP Relaxation:**
```python
# Instead of: x ‚àà {0, 1} (binary)
# GLOP uses: 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1 (continuous)

# This makes the problem much easier to solve!
```

**2. Simplex Algorithm:**
```
Start at feasible corner point
  ‚Üì
Check adjacent corner points
  ‚Üì
Move to better corner point
  ‚Üì
Repeat until optimal corner found
```

**3. Dual Simplex:**
- Maintains dual feasibility
- Works from outside feasible region
- Often faster for constraint-heavy problems

**4. Rounding (for Integer Solutions):**
```python
# After solving LP relaxation
if x.solution_value() > 0.5:
    x_integer = 1
else:
    x_integer = 0
```

### üí™ Strengths

**1. Extreme Speed**
```python
# Same problem as CP-SAT
# GLOP: 3-8 seconds
# CP-SAT: 25-45 seconds
# Speedup: 5-10x faster! üöÄ
```

**2. Scales to Large Problems**
```
1,000 items: CP-SAT struggles, GLOP handles easily
10,000 items: CP-SAT times out, GLOP still works
```

**3. Predictable Performance**
```
O(n¬≥) time complexity (polynomial!)
Much better than CP-SAT's exponential worst case
```

**4. Low Memory Usage**
```
Uses less memory than CP-SAT
Can handle larger problems on same hardware
```

### ‚ö° Performance Characteristics

**Time Complexity:**
- Average: O(n¬≤ √ó m) to O(n¬≥)
- n = variables, m = constraints
- Polynomial, not exponential!

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n √ó m) for constraint matrix
- Very efficient

**Typical Performance (Your System):**
```
50 items, 10 options each, 12 time slots = ~6,000 variables
Expected time: 3-8 seconds ‚ö°
Solution quality: Good (LP relaxation + rounding)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

**1. Not Truly Optimal for Integer Problems**
```python
# True optimal: Select options A, B, C ‚Üí Total cost $10,000
# GLOP rounded: Select options A, B, D ‚Üí Total cost $10,050
# Gap: 0.5% (usually acceptable)
```

**2. Can't Handle Complex Logic**
```python
# CP-SAT can do:
model.AddImplication(x, y)

# GLOP can't directly handle:
# - If-then constraints
# - All-or-nothing
# - Complex bundling
```

**3. Requires Linearization**
```python
# Non-linear: cost = base_cost √ó (1 - discount)^quantity
# Must linearize for GLOP (may lose some accuracy)
```

### üéØ Best Use Cases in Your System

**1. Quick Feasibility Checks**
```python
# "Can I procure everything within budget?"
# GLOP answers in 5 seconds instead of 30
```

**2. Large-Scale Procurement**
```python
# 500+ items across 20 projects
# GLOP handles, CP-SAT times out
```

**3. Initial Exploration**
```python
# Day 1: Run GLOP to understand problem
# Day 2: Refine with CP-SAT if needed
```

**4. Production Speed Requirements**
```python
# Need results in < 10 seconds?
# GLOP is your solver
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

```python
solver = pywraplp.Solver.CreateSolver('GLOP')

# Time limit (milliseconds)
solver.SetTimeLimit(60000)  # 60 seconds

# Solution precision
solver.set_parameters("solution_feasibility_tolerance", 1e-6)

# Algorithm choice
# GLOP automatically chooses between:
# - Primal Simplex
# - Dual Simplex
# - Barrier method
```

### üìä Real-World Example

**Your Procurement Scenario:**
```python
# Problem: 100 items, 5 options each, 12 periods
# LP Relaxation: 6,000 continuous variables

# Linear constraints:
# - Budget: Œ£(cost √ó quantity) ‚â§ budget_limit
# - Demand: Œ£(selection_vars) = 1 per item

# GLOP Solution:
# Time: 5-8 seconds ‚ö°
# Status: OPTIMAL (for LP relaxation)
# After rounding: FEASIBLE (99% as good as true optimal)
```
