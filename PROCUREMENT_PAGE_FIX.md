# Procurement Page Data Retrieval Fix

## Issue Summary
After implementing the PMO finalization feature, the procurement page couldn't retrieve data and was showing a 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error:

```
GET http://localhost:3000/items/finalized 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
```

## Root Cause
**FastAPI Route Ordering Issue**

In FastAPI, route definitions are processed in order. When you have:
1. A parameterized route like `@router.get("/{item_id}")` 
2. A static route like `@router.get("/finalized")`

If the parameterized route comes **before** the static route, FastAPI will try to match `/items/finalized` against `/{item_id}` first, attempting to parse the string "finalized" as an integer parameter `item_id`. This causes a validation error (422).

### Problem Location
In `backend/app/routers/items.py`:
- Line 61 (old): `@router.get("/{item_id}")` - came BEFORE
- Line 166 (old): `@router.get("/finalized")` - came AFTER ❌

## Solution
**Move static routes before parameterized routes**

The fix was to reorder the endpoints so that `/finalized` is defined **before** `/{item_id}`:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT ORDER:
@router.post("/", response_model=ProjectItem)
async def create_new_project_item(...):
    ...

@router.get("/finalized")  # Static route FIRST
async def list_finalized_items(...):
    ...

@router.get("/{item_id}", response_model=ProjectItem)  # Parameterized route AFTER
async def get_project_item_by_id(...):
    ...
```

## Changes Made
1. **Moved** the `/finalized` endpoint definition from line 166 to line 61 (before `/{item_id}`)
2. **Removed** the duplicate `/finalized` endpoint that was at the bottom of the file

## File Modified
- `backend/app/routers/items.py` - Reordered routes to fix FastAPI routing

## Testing
After this fix:
1. Restart the backend server
2. The procurement page should now successfully retrieve finalized items
3. The endpoint `/items/finalized` will be matched correctly before attempting to parse it as `/{item_id}`

## Key Takeaway
**In FastAPI, always define static routes before parameterized routes!**

This is a common FastAPI gotcha that affects route matching order. More specific/static routes should always come before more general/parameterized routes in the router definition.
