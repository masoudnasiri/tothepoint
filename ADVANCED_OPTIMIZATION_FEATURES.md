## 🚀 **Typical Workflow**

### **Scenario 1: Standard Optimization**

```
1. Click "Run Optimization"
2. Configure:
   - Solver: CP_SAT
   - Time: 120s
   - Multiple Proposals: Yes
3. Wait for results (2-3 min)
4. Review all 5 proposals
5. Select best proposal tab
6. Click "Save Proposal as Decisions"
7. Done! ✅
```

### **Scenario 2: Optimization with Manual Adjustments**

```
1. Run optimization (as above)
2. Select preferred proposal
3. Review decisions
4. Edit: Change supplier for Item-A (click ✏️)
5. Remove: Remove Item-B (click 🗑️)
6. Add: Add Item-C (click "Add Item")
7. Review changes (see badges)
8. Click "Save Proposal as Decisions"
9. Done with customizations! ✅
```

### **Scenario 3: Compare Solvers**

```
1. Run with CP_SAT → Note: 45s, $125K
2. Delete results
3. Run with GLOP → Note: 8s, $127K
4. Decision: GLOP is 5x faster, only 2% more expensive
5. Use GLOP for production! ✅
```

## 💡 **Best Practices**

### **When to Edit Decisions**

✅ **DO Edit When:**
- Optimization chose suboptimal supplier for specific item
- Want to adjust quantities based on new information
- Need to change timing for business reasons
- Have supplier preferences not captured in data

❌ **DON'T Edit When:**
- Want different overall strategy (re-run with different strategy instead)
- Making many changes (might indicate wrong configuration)
- Uncertain about impact (test in development first)

### **When to Add Items**

✅ **DO Add When:**
- Forgot to include an item in project
- New requirement emerged after optimization
- Want to manually add rush order
- Testing "what-if" scenarios

### **When to Remove Items**

✅ **DO Remove When:**
- Item no longer needed
- Will be procured separately
- Outside current budget cycle
- Deferred to next period

### **When to Delete Results**

✅ **DO Delete When:**
- Testing different configurations
- Results are outdated
- Want to start fresh
- Made mistakes in setup

⚠️ **DON'T Delete When:**
- Just want to try different proposal (use tabs!)
- Already saved decisions (delete decisions instead)
- Sharing results with team (export first)

---

## 🎯 **Keyboard Shortcuts**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Switch between proposal tabs |
| `Enter` | In edit dialog → Save |
| `Esc` | Close any open dialog |
| Click row | (Future) Quick view details |

---

## 📋 **State Management**

### **Local State (Not Saved)**

These are tracked locally until you save:
- Edited decisions
- Removed decisions  
- Added decisions

**Indicators:**
- "Has local changes" chip
- Highlighted rows
- Status badges

**Persisted By:**
- Clicking "Save Proposal as Decisions"

### **Server State (Saved)**

These persist across sessions:
- Optimization runs
- Optimization results
- Finalized decisions
- Locked decisions

---

## 🔄 **Coming Soon**

Features planned for next iteration:

1. **Finalize/Lock Proposals** - Lock decisions to prevent re-optimization
2. **Bulk Edit** - Edit multiple decisions at once
3. **Export Proposals** - Export to Excel/PDF
4. **Compare Proposals** - Side-by-side diff view
5. **Proposal Templates** - Save configurations as templates
6. **Undo/Redo** - Undo local changes before saving
7. **Version History** - Track all optimization runs
8. **Comments** - Add notes to decisions

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Can't see "Edit" buttons**

**Solution:** Check user role. Need to be admin, finance, or PM.

### **Problem: "Save Proposal" button disabled**

**Solution:** Check if `saving` state is true. Wait for previous operation to complete.

### **Problem: Edits not persisting**

**Solution:** Make sure to click "Save Proposal as Decisions" button after editing.

### **Problem: Can't add items**

**Solution:** Ensure procurement options exist in database.

### **Problem: "Has local changes" won't clear**

**Solution:** Save the proposal or refresh page to discard changes.
